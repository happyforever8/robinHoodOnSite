You are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. You are also given an integer k.

For every i and j where 0 <= i < j < arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].

Return the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].

 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3
Output: [2,5]
Explanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,7], k = 1
Output: [1,7]
 

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 104
arr[0] == 1
arr[i] is a prime number for i > 0.
All the numbers of arr are unique and sorted in strictly increasing order.
1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2


This solution probably doesn't have the best runtime but it's really simple and easy to understand.

Says if the list is [1, 7, 23, 29, 47], we can easily have this table of relationships

1/47  < 1/29    < 1/23 < 1/7
7/47  < 7/29    < 7/23
23/47 < 23/29
29/47
So now the problem becomes "find the kth smallest element of (n-1) sorted list"

Following is my implementation using PriorityQueue, running time is O(nlogn) O(max(n,k) * logn), space is O(n):

    public int[] kthSmallestPrimeFraction(int[] a, int k) {
        int n = a.length;
        // 0: numerator idx, 1: denominator idx
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] o1, int[] o2) {
                int s1 = a[o1[0]] * a[o2[1]];
                int s2 = a[o2[0]] * a[o1[1]];
                return s1 - s2;
            }
        });
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            pq.add(new int[]{i, n-1});
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < k-1; i++) {
            int[] pop = pq.remove();
            int ni = pop[0];
            int di = pop[1];
            if (pop[1] - 1 > pop[0]) {
                pop[1]--;
                pq.add(pop);
            }
        }

        int[] peek = pq.peek();
        return new int[]{a[peek[0]], a[peek[1]]};
    }
